        <h4>What is the emergent curriculum?</h4>
          <p class="linespace pt-2" >  According to the <a href="#bri">Brighter Horizons (2021)</a>, the emergent curriculum is a developmentally appropriate approach that plans children’s learning in early childhood education. It is also an alignment with the children’s interests, strength, needs and abilities that inspires children with a lifelong passion of learning and provides them with diverse learning experiences. </p> 
          <p class="linespace pt-2" > 
            Furthermore, in our play curriculum we follow the Flight Alberta Framework Curriculum where the child is seen as mighty learner and citizen <a href="#mak">(Makovichuk et al., 2014) </a>. We also use the collaborative approach in which educators, children and families are involved in the learning for the children’s success.

            "When parents observe their children in play or join with them in child-driven play, they are given a unique opportunity to see the world from their child’s vantage point as the child navigates a world perfectly created just to fit his or her needs" <a href="#gin">(Ginsburg, et al., 2007) </a>.

        <h4>What is the role of our educators in the curriculum?</h4>
          <p class="linespace pt-2" > 
          In our curriculum, the role of our educators is crucial and appreciated. They provide learning experiences with some challenges to encourage the children to use their problem-solving skills. In addition, our educators use their listening and communication skills to stay engaged in the children’s play; through the day, our educators observe the children and document objectively their play to find their abilities, needs and interests. Later, our educators plan appropriately and expand the children's ideas in new ways. They also inspire them and act as role models so the children can collaborate well with others. By the end of each day, our educators’ report will be shared individually with the parents through our app, and the parents are more than welcome to comment on it and share their children’s interests at home.

        <h4>You might be wondering how playing affects children’s learning!</h4>
          <p class="linespace pt-2" > 
          According to the <a href="#gin" style="padding-top:130px">Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics (2007)</a>, “Play is so important to optimal child development that it has been recognized by the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights as a right of every child”. </p>
          <p>
          Our play-based curriculum “…helps children develop social skills, motivation to learn, and even language and numeracy skills. Taking initiative, focused attention, and curiosity about the world are all a part of play” (Wonderschool, 2022).

          </figure> 
          <p> 
          Our curriculum is based on child-led and open-ended play, and it offers many benefits for the children on their cognitive, social emotional and physical development (Table 1).

    <h4>What are the centers in our classroom?</h4>
    <p> 
      Our classroom provides a welcoming, inspiring, multicultural environment for the children to learn explore and create in a safe place. It is divided into different centers such as science, literacy and numeracy, writing, reading, dramatic play, art and building so the children can be exposed to different materials to pick their play.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end, our facility with the emergent play-based curriculum is an excellent place for your children to develop their love for learning and be ready for school. Our well-trained educators are committed to your children and learning.
